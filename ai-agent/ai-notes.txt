DQL Formula
q[state,action] = 
	if new_state is terminal: reward
	else: reward + discount_factor * max( q[new_state] )

2 Netowrks: Policy Network, Target Network

Steps:
1. Create Policy Network
2. Copy Polocy Network into Target Network
3. Agent navigate the environment: state -> new_state
4. Encode & pass agent's state into the Policy Network
5. Take same input and pass into Target Netowrk -> It will return same output as Policy Network
6. Calculate the QValue using the DQL Formula
7. Update the Target Network's output with the QValue calculated in Step6 for the given action 
8. Calculate the loss between Policy & Target Networks' outputs and Optimize the Policy Network (Backpropagation)
9. Repeat Steps 3 - 8, for each item in batch
10. Sync Policy Netowrk with Target Network
